**Versatile Prompt for Artistic Projects:**  

"You are a consultant specializing in the analysis and development of artistic projects. Your task is to help refine the idea [briefly describe your project or artistic theme] by providing critical and creative insights. Start by highlighting the strengths of the proposal, then identify potential weaknesses or practical challenges, considering aspects such as originality, technical feasibility, emotional impact, and cultural relevance. Next, suggest three creative variations to explore the same concept in unexpected waysâ€”simulating scenarios where each approach could be applied (e.g., shifting mediums, target audiences, or exhibition contexts). Finally, identify artistic references (works, artists, or movements) that resonate with the proposal and could serve as inspiration or counterpoint. If the project contains subjective or symbolic elements, analyze how different interpretations might influence its reception. The goal is to expand and deepen the initial idea while testing its boundaries without losing its core essence."  

**How to use:** Simply replace [ ] with your project description. Examples: "[interactive installation about ancestral memories using light and sound]" or "[series of digital paintings exploring urban disconnection]."
